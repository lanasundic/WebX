        <p title="meow">Cats are curious, independent, and graceful animals known for their playful and affectionate nature.<br> 
            They communicate through purring, meowing, and body language, often forming strong bonds with their owners.<br> 
            Whether napping in sunny spots or chasing toys, cats bring comfort and joy to many homes.

        <h2 class="etymologyAndNaming">Etymology and naming</h2>
        <p title="puuskatte">The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.<br>
            The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language. The Nubian word kaddîska (wildcat) and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates<br>
            The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt.

        <p class="catPoemTitle">Whiskers in the Sun</>
        <pre class="catPoemText">
            Soft paws tiptoe on the floor,
            A gentle purr, a quiet snore.
            Golden eyes that gleam and gleam,
            Chasing shadows in a dream.

            Curling tight in a sunbeam's glow,
            The world outside moves fast and slow.
            Silent friend with fur so fine,
            Oh little cat, forever mine.
        </pre>
