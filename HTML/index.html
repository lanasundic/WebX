        <h1>Cats :3</h1>

        <p title="meow">Cats are curious, independent, and graceful animals known for their playful and affectionate nature.<br> 
            They communicate through purring, meowing, and body language, often forming strong bonds with their owners.<br> 
            Whether napping in sunny spots or chasing toys, cats bring comfort and joy to many homes.
